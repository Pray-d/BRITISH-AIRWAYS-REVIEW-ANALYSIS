## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains the work completed during the British Airways Data Science Job Simulation conducted in September 2023. The simulation provided an opportunity to explore the critical role of data science in the success of British Airways. In this project, we focused on scraping and analyzing customer review data to uncover insights and built a predictive model to understand the factors that influence buying behavior for British Airways customers.

## Project Overview
British Airways, as a global airline, relies heavily on data-driven insights to enhance its services and customer experience. In this simulation, we addressed the following key tasks:

1. **Data Collection**: We scraped and collected customer review data related to British Airways to gain insights into customer sentiment and feedback.

2. **Data Analysis**: We conducted in-depth data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights from the customer review data.

3. **Predictive Modeling**: We built a predictive model to understand the factors that influence buying behavior among British Airways customers. This model aims to provide valuable information for marketing and service improvement efforts.

## Data Collection
For this project, we collected customer review data from various online sources, including social media, review websites, and surveys. The data collection process involved web scraping and data cleaning to ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset. The collected data included customer reviews, ratings, and other relevant information.

## Data Analysis
Our data analysis phase focused on extracting meaningful insights from the collected customer review data. Some of the key activities in this phase included:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: We performed sentiment analysis to gauge overall customer sentiment towards British Airways.

- **Topic Modeling**: We identified common topics and themes within the customer reviews, helping us understand what aspects of the airline experience matter most to customers.

- **Customer Segmentation**: We segmented customers based on their feedback and preferences, allowing for more targeted marketing and service improvements.

- **Visualization**: We created visualizations to present our findings effectively, including word clouds, bar charts, and heatmaps.

## Predictive Modeling
Building a predictive model was a critical part of this project. We used machine learning techniques to create a model that predicts factors influencing buying behavior. The model took into account various features, including customer demographics, review sentiment, and historical data.

## Conclusion
The British Airways Data Science Job Simulation allowed us to gain valuable insights into the airline industry and the importance of data science in enhancing customer experiences. By scraping and analyzing customer review data and building a predictive model, we demonstrated how data-driven decision-making can positively impact an airline's success.
